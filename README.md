## Rules

Sokoban (Soko-Ban, [jpn](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%AF%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA). 倉庫番, sokoban — storekeeper) is 2D game-puzzle, in which the player must place the boxes in the designated places of the maze. The storekeeper can only move one box at a time by pushing it forward.

## History

Game Sokoban was created in 1981 year by Hiroyuki Imabayashi and published in 1982 year by japanese company Thinking Rabbit. Also, the company has released three sequels: [Boxxle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxxle), Sokoban Perfect и Sokoban Revenge.

The game has been implemented for a lot of computer platforms, including almost all home and personal computers. There are also versions of the game for pocket computers, game consoles, digital cameras, mobile phones and TV. 

## Scientific investigation

The Sokoban game is interesting in terms of computational complexity. The difficulty of solving Sokoban levels is caused by both the strong branching of the decision tree (comparable to chess) and its great depth — some levels require more than 1000 pushes of boxes to solve.
